# Agentic Ethereum Project

"AI-Driven Domain NFT Marketplace" under Brandexia - AI Powered, Blockchain Secured Branding Solution

Combining AI Agents & Blockchain for Branding Innovation

Given the hackathonâ€™s development time constraint and the need for both AI and blockchain integration, the Domain NFTs project offers the most viable implementation. This project is both impactful and quick to implement, while aligning with Brandexia's broader vision of securing branding assets through blockchain.

Why This Project?
âœ… Quick to Build:

The core logic (minting NFTs, smart contracts for ownership, AI integration for recommendations) can be built within 2 days.
Can use existing libraries/tools for NFT minting (OpenZeppelin, Alchemy, IPFS).
âœ… AI + Blockchain Integration:

AI Agent recommends domain names based on industry, SEO trends, and brand identity.
Blockchain ensures domain ownership security via NFTs, reducing disputes and fraud.
âœ… Scalable for Brandexia's Future:

Future iterations can add leasing functionality, escrow smart contracts, and decentralized storage.

Project Scope & Implementation Plan
Core Features
AI-Powered Domain Name Recommendation (Frontend & AI Model)

AI Agent suggests domain names based on business category, keywords, and branding preferences.
Uses GPT-4 or a fine-tuned NLP model to analyze available domains and recommend the best matches.
Example: User enters "Fitness Brand," AI suggests "FitGuru.com," "AthleticEdge.io," etc.
NFT-Based Domain Ownership (Blockchain Backend)

When a user selects a domain, it is minted as an NFT (ERC-721) on Ethereum or Polygon.
Smart contract stores domain details and ensures transparent ownership.
Users can buy, sell, or lease domain NFTs via the platform.
Smart Contracts for Secure Transfers

Automated contract execution for domain transfers or leasing agreements (use OpenZeppelin templates).
Royalties for the original domain owner can be encoded in the contract for resale.
Decentralized Storage (Optional, If Time Allows)

IPFS stores branding metadata (logo, tagline) linked to the domain NFT.


Roadmap
Timeframe	Task	Tech Stack
Day 1: Backend Development	Deploy ERC-721 Smart Contracts for domain NFTs (Ethereum/Polygon).	Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat, Alchemy
Set up IPFS storage for metadata (optional).	IPFS/Filecoin
Implement NFT Minting & Transfer Logic (buy/sell/lease functions).	Solidity, Web3.js, TheGraph
Day 2: AI Agent Integration	Fine-tune GPT-4 to generate brandable domain names based on user input.	OpenAI API, Python/Flask
Implement AI-based SEO keyword matching to suggest optimal domains.	LangChain, Hugging Face NLP models
Day 3: Frontend Development	Build a simple UI for domain search, AI recommendations, and NFT minting.	React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
Connect UI to smart contract functions (buy, sell, lease NFTs).	Web3.js, MetaMask
Implement AI-Agent API calls to recommend domains in real-time.	Flask, FastAPI
Day 4: Testing & Deployment	Test contract deployments on Goerli (Ethereum Testnet).	Hardhat, Infura
Demo UI walkthrough & record demo video.	OBS, Postman, GitHub Pages


Demo Walkthrough (For Hackathon Presentation)
User Visits Platform:
Enters brand category (e.g., "Fitness"), AI suggests domains (e.g., "FitGuru.com").
AI Agent Provides SEO Insights:
AI ranks domain names based on branding trends, keyword strength.
User Selects & Mints as NFT:
Domain is tokenized as an ERC-721 NFT.
Blockchain Ensures Ownership:
Transaction recorded on Ethereum/Polygon.
Domain Leasing (Optional Expansion):
Smart contract enables leasing functionality with automated payments.
Future Potential
ðŸ”¥ Expand to full Branding Asset NFTs (logos, taglines, etc.)
ðŸ”¥ Integrate with ENS (Ethereum Name Service) for on-chain identity management
ðŸ”¥ AI Agents for Automated Website Creation based on domain NFT
